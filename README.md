ANTIC
=====

ANTIC is my atari 8-bit series emulator.  It relies heavily on harmony generators
for cycle accurate CPU emulation.  I will be doing active development inside of
chrome with harmony flags enable to make sure that compatibility is high between
browsers and maintaining forward compatbility.
